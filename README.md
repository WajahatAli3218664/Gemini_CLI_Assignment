## Development Tools

This project was developed with the assistance of **Gemini CLI**, a command-line interface tool powered by Google's Gemini AI model. Gemini CLI was used to generate code snippets, provide design suggestions, and assist in debugging during the development process. It helped streamline the creation of HTML and CSS components, ensuring a clean and modern design inspired by Canva's aesthetic.
